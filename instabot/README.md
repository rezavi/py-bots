## WELCOME TO INSTABOT:

- Please make sure you have completed the prerequisite steps in the main [README.md](../README.md).
- Before running the bot scripts you will need to do the following:
    - Add the following values to the os environ:
        1. Instagram username as INSTA_USERNAME.
        2. Instagram password as INSTA_PASSWORD.
        3. Path to webdriver as WEBDRIVER_PATH.
    - To do this, commands will depend on the OS. For example on linux:
        ```export INSTA_USERNAME = 'username'```.
    - You can also SKIP this step by replacing the values in the code itself!
    - For example, in the [unfollower bot](unfollower.py), replace line numbers: ```8, 9, 32```.
